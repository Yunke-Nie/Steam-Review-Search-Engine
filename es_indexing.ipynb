You are able to play on Low Quality Graphical settings. There is a resolution slidebar available. 0% 100% You are able to play this game on Fullscreen or windowed mode.Volume Settings Information. There is a main volume slidebar available. 0% 100% There is a Menu volume slidebar available. 0% 100% Headphones are recommended.Miscellaneous Information. There are alot of different languages available. You are able to play the game with a controller There is a mouse and controller sensitivity slidebar available. 0% 100% For Killer and survivor (both seperated). You are able to change the controls on the keyboard and controller. There is a manual Tutorial/help/tips available.About the game.You can choose between a Survivor or a killer. You are able to have 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer. Each side has an objective. The killer has to kill all 4 survivors in order to win while the survivors has to escape from the map. Survivors are using third person camera and killers are using a first person camera. Each survivor or a killer has their own level and perk system. So if you have unlocked an offering the offering can only be used in a match if you play that certain character.Survivors are able to use items and increase the effect of the item by adding add ons while the killer has a default power ability which can be improved by adding add ons. Offerings could be used to change the match or by gaining more points. The game is Trial and error and WILL BE DIFFICULT IN THE BEGINNING.While the game is pretty dark by itself you are able to increase the brightness by darkening your own room or increase the brightness on your computer monitor. This may have a little impact or no impact at all but if you are close to a window or the sun has the potential to shine into your room. You could be put in a disadvantage as you will have a hard time looking at the screen or able to see things properly. Killer needs to kill the 4 survivors in order to win. There are alot of different killers each with their own unique gameplay and perks. Some killers are able to go invisible or even stealth while other killers are using deadly tools to get their victims. The killer has a first person camera perspective which means he can\\'t use their camera to look around the walls for victims. Killers are able to see ALL Generators and exit gates throughout the match which could help you locating survivors.You will have to hunt down the survivors and they could reveal themself on the map if they are failing a skillcheck helping a survivor off the hook or destroying a hex totem. Chasing a survivor will start the \"Chase music\" until the victim is down or escaped. An injured or a running survivor will leave a trail of red marks around the location which you need to track down in order to kill them. A killer is able to hear nearby \"grunting/moaning\" sound when a survivor is injured. The killer is able to kick generators to slow and decrease the generator progress or destroying thrown pallets by kicking them. Killers are generally faster than a survivor and the killer\\'s movement speed will increase the longer the chase goes as they have \"Bloodlust\". Survivor needs to escape from the map by completing generators to power up the exit gate or they are able to find a hatch. There are alot of different survivors each with their own gameplay and perks. Some are good for co op actions while others are quickly. Survivors have a third person camera which will allow them to see around the walls and keep the killer at a distance. You will have to find generators to power up the exit gates to make your escape.Generators are randomly spawned on the map and could be located by looking up as you will see sparky flashlights. From time to time you will receive a skillcheck which you will need to success in order to prevent the generator blowing up and able to reveal your location on the game. Blowing up generators will lose some of your progess and could put you into danger as well. By reparing enough generators the exit gates will be powered up and you COULD leave the area after opening the gates. You could also find a hatch which will allow you to escape but the killer is able to grab you out of the hatch if he is quick enough.There are 2 hitchecks on a skillcheck The thick white bar and a smaller bar. Before the skillcheck will pop up you will hear a \"ping\" sound. Hitting the Bigger white bar will gain you more experience and you will gain 2% more progress but you are better off focusing on the smaller bar as it will be alot easier to hit. Most actions ingame require a skillcheck and missing a skillcheck will reveal your location to the killer. You are able to find items in crates such a medkit or a toolbox. Items has a quality level and make them more powerful the higher it is. Items are usually an one time thing as you will lose them if you have died or they run out of charges. You are able to to carry an item to the next match if you have escaped.The survivor is able to jump over windows throw down pallets or hide in lockers. Lockers are not a good hiding location and you will be instantly grabbed by the killer if spotted. You are better off crouching and hiding behind obstactles. A common mistake what people are doing is Running. If they see a killer and it is close to a survivor they have a tendency to run which will be a big mistake as this will reveal your location to the killer alot easier. You should only start running when you are being chased or you know for sure the killer isn\\'t close to you.Ingame Information. Moderate replayability. Good Atmosphere. Dark graphical horror atmosphere. Has Perks and level systems. Each survivor/killer has their own system. Dialy randoms quests to gain an insane ammount of experience.Miscellaneous Information. Dwight and Nea are both good beginning characters. Worst enemies could be your allies while the killer could be your friend. Pallets are buggy Don\\'t throw the pallet if you are facing it. It could teleport you to the other side and screw you over.Other things.The game isn\\'t that fun as it may seem. Why? If you are playing as a killer you will fight against a bunch of \"high\" skilled trolls and they are usally pre made as well. They are mostly pallet/window jumping flashlighting and shamefully t bagging.If you are playing as a survivor you will play against a killer that may be alot better than you are. Sometimes teammates are disconnecting in a middle of the match which will leave you in a disadvantage they also have the tendecies to really screw you over. Sometimes even on purpose.Survivors are generally alot more toxic salty trolly and generally have a negative attitude than a killer will ever get in this game. Killers mostly relies on mistakes from the survivors and sometimes are more friendlier than a survivor.I will only suggest to buy this game whenever it is in a discount. Otherwise i would suggest to stay away from it. The idea of the game is nice Community however isn\\'t and can be really frustating or game ruining.I have reached the text review limit. T T \\'( Reviews are always uploaded if i have at least played for 2 hours or more. Unless the game is really garbage and doesn\\'t deserve the 2H limit.I Give this game a 7/10', 'title': 'Dead by Daylight', 'sentiment': 'Positive', 'Dominant_Topic': 0, 'Perc_Contribution': 0.9986, 'Topic_Keywords': 'like, time, get, fun, play, still, even, player, one, really', 'funny_z_score': -0.011143816181542173}\n"
